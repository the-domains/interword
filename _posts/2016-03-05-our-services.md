# Our Services

With Interword Interpreting Services, claims specialists, medical and law offices, as well as individuals can easily connect with high quality certified and qualified interpreters of a wide variety of languages. We incorporate technology to offer unbeatable quality, reliability and value. 

We have built a network of hand-picked certified and qualified interpreters and translators who can work from home at the time that works for them. 

Our mission is to give more people freedom to work from home or at locations that are the most convenient for them with flexible hours, so we are able to cover assignments statewide. 

With our highly trained interpreters we do not just aid in communication, we help an injured worker to be an active participant in his own recovery.
